A VPN encrypts data sent through public networks so that hackers and other malicious actors cannot intercept it. Additionally, a VPN can help users bypass censorship blocks and access geo-restricted content.\nUsing a VPN on an iPhone 14 can keep user data secure even when using public Wi-Fi networks. Since the VPN encrypts all data sent over the connection, a user’s information cannot be intercepted by hackers.

A VPN encrypts data sent through public networks so that hackers and other malicious actors cannot intercept it. Additionally, a VPN can help users bypass censorship blocks and access geo-restricted content.</p><p>Using a VPN on an iPhone 14 can keep user data secure even when using public Wi-Fi networks.
